What is nginx Sendfile?
Enabling sendfile

By default, NGINX handles file transmission itself and copies the file into the buffer before sending it. Enabling the sendfile directive eliminates the step of copying the data into the buffer and enables direct copying data from one file descriptor to another.

sendfile            on;



What is tcp_nopush?
tcp_nopush. tcp_nopush is opposite to tcp_nodelay . Instead of pushing packages as fast as possible, it aims to optimise the amount of data sent simultaneously. It will force the package to wait until it gets its maximum size (MSS) before sending it to the client. This directive only works, when sendfile is on.

The better start can be the set of following rules:

1. disable logging and accept_mutex
2. enable sendfile
3. set sendfile_max_chunk

Configuration:

events {
    accept_mutex off;
}

access_log off;
sendfile on;
sendfile_max_chunk 512k;
